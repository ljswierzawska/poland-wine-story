        <p class="date">February 16, 2026</p>

        <p>Climate change has changed the demographics of wine production. 
            Rising temperatures have redefined the lines of winemaking regions, revealing some new contenders. 
            In Europe, the shift was <a href="https://europeancorrespondent.com/en/r/europes-grapes-are-moving-north">northwards</a> 
            with Poland leading this transformation. 
</p>

        <p>As Victoria Brzezinski <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/polish-wine-guide">wrote</a> for the British Vogue Magazine, 
            it’s an unexpected turn of events seemingly far from “a land of potato and grain, tinnies of Tyskie and the clinks 
            of vodka-filled shot glasses at every wedding.” But here we are, with over 700 registered wineries in Poland. 
</p>

        <p>With increasingly favorable conditions, a new generation of winemakers is driving the expansion of vineyards 
            and the shift to wine grapes in Poland.

</div>
        <p style="margin-top: 2em;">Poland's wine production has grown steadily since 2009, with one exception: the 2017-18 season, 
            when poor weather conditions battered vineyards across Europe. Italy, France and Spain saw similar drops.
</p>

        <p>In 2009, Poland's <a href="https://notesfrompoland.com/2021/11/19/whites-and-reds-a-guide-to-polish-wine/#:~:text=Vineyards%20were%20once%20widespread%20in,the%20figure%20now%20is%20380.&text=Registered%20vineyards%20in%20Poland%20occupy,wine%20is%20increasing%20in%20popularity.">first legal commercial wine</a> reached the market. 
            The milestone followed regulatory reforms that dismantled restrictive laws which had prevented homegrown winemakers 
            from selling their bottles. The same year 21 vineyards declared commercial production.

  While this viticultural awakening may raise some eyebrows, Poland is not entirely new to winemaking. 
  The country’s 
  <a href="https://culture.pl/en/article/how-poland-became-an-unlikely-wine-country-an-interview-with-wojciech-bonkowski">
    wine production history
  </a> 
  dates back to the Middle Ages, when it was quite developed, until the Little Ice Age – a period of cooling in the Northern Hemisphere. 
  According to Wojciech Bońkowski, wine production in Poland was hampered once again in the 1960s, this time by the communist government, which prioritized the production of fruit wine and shut down major wineries.

    highest concentration
  </a> 
  of wineries is found in the southern and western voivodeships (Poland’s administrative provinces), which offer warmer and drier conditions.

<p>While Poland's climate remains challenging with short growing seasons and brutal winters, producers are adapting. Winemakers have moved beyond cold-resistant hybrids like Seyval Blanc and Regent to experiment with Solaris, Johanniter, Pinot Noir, and even <a href="https://churrascophuket.substack.com/p/polands-wines-coming-in-from-the">Chardonnay</a>. According to the <a href="https://www.gov.pl/attachment/8b06ecec-89e9-4986-a2fb-d00e4a20fe50">National Support Centre for Agriculture (KOWR)</a>, white wines dominate production.</p>

<p>The Polish winemaking industry has come a long and turbulent journey, but for now at least, the numbers suggest that Poland is emerging as a wine producer that can no longer be dismissed.</p>
